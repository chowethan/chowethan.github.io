summary: An all-purpose Discord bot for private use in our Discord server.
---

Cassandra is a Discord bot written in JavaScript that utilizes the [discord.io](https://github.com/izy521/discord.io) library. I initially wrote this bot to serve as a simple music bot for our Discord server, but it quickly grew into a larger library of various utility and general use commands.

This bot was written in JavaScript, but no longer functions properly because the discord.io library has not been updated to work with the new Discord gateway. It used [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) to parse audio metadata and play audio.
