summary: An all-purpose Discord bot for private use in our Discord server.
---

Cassandra is a Discord bot written in JavaScript that utilized the [discord.io](https://github.com/izy521/discord.io) library and [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) to parse audio metadata and play audio. I initially wrote this bot to serve as a simple music bot for our Discord server, but it quickly grew into a larger library of various utility and general use commands.

discord.io no longer communicates with Discord properly because the gateway version that discord.io uses is no longer supported by Discord. This library has not been updated to work with the new Discord gateway, so the bot no longer works.
